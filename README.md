# LM2670SX-Carrier

A basic carrier for the LM2670SX a step down 3 amp switching regulator by TI. Selecting the correct version -3.3 -5 and the -12 for the fixed output value you need. If you need the Adjustable Model then use the -Adj project and Files. They are Drop-in / Pin Compatible but require a change in schematics to make them work for the application. 

The values I have are for a Vin == 12 Volts Vout == 3.3 and current of 3A. Please reference the data sheet for the values of L1 and the Capacitors for your Vin&&Amp requirements. If using the ADJ version you will have to reference the datasheet for the correct design and value selection for the Resistors/Cap/Inductor Values.
