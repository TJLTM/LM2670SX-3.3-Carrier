A basic carrier for the LM2670SX a step down 3 amp switching regulator by TI. Selecting the correct version -3.3 -5 and the -12 for the fixed output value you need. 

The values I have are for a Vin == 12 Volts Vout == 3.3 and current of 3A. Please reference the data sheet for the values of L1 and the Capacitors for your Vin&&Amp requirements
